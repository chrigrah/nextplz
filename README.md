nextplz
=======

nextplz is a simple Go application for browsing and playing video files. It uses termbox-go, a terminal UI library, to provide a clear and simple to use interface. By providing recursive video listings, instant searching/filtering of files and folders, and keybindings for common operations, nextplz aims to provide an interface that is quick and easy to use.

Observe: At this time the application looks for the executable 'vlc' on the system path and uses that for a media player. If you want to use another media player, please look under Usage below.

Secret sauce
==============
For some reason VLC will not queue files while it has a video paused, so nextplz can toggle pause in VLC for you with the ctrl+space key combination. For this to work VLC must have been started from nextplz, or otherwise been configured so that it is listening for commands on TCP port 47246.
